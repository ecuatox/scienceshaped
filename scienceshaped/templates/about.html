    <h3>WHO</h3>
    <p>
      I founded Science Shaped in Jan 2015 after years experiencing that my graphical assistance made my colleagues very pleased. I have a MSc in cell biology (1993, University of Trondheim), a PhD in stem cell biology (2010, University of Oslo) and education in media design (2005, Idéfagskolen, Nøtterøy). Currently, I work as a post.doc at Department of Tumor Biology at the Institute for Cancer Research at Oslo University Hospital, where I have also worked at Department of Immunolgy.
